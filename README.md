CMSE202 Final Project:
In this project my group and I wanted to see if we could use some of the machine learning techniques we learned to see if we could make accurate predictions regarding the outcome of every NFL regular season game without knowing the score. To do this we took all of the data available from every game of the 2019 season and used it to develop a model to predict the winner and loser of every game that had happened in the 2020 season. We developed a basic logistic regression model and were able to obtain a 96% accuracy of predicting the outcome with that model. We also performed a principal component analysis to see if we could eliminate certain features that were being used in the model but found that the more features made the model more accurate.
