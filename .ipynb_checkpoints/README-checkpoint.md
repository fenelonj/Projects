# CMSE202 Final Project:
In this project my group and I wanted to see if we could use some of the machine learning techniques we learned to see if we could make accurate predictions regarding the outcome of every NFL regular season game without knowing the score. To do this we took all of the data available from every game of the 2019 season and used it to develop a model to predict the winner and loser of every game that had happened in the 2020 season. We developed a basic logistic regression model and were able to obtain a 96% accuracy of predicting the outcome with that model. We also performed a principal component analysis to see if we could eliminate certain features that were being used in the model but found that the more features made the model more accurate.

# Classical Mechanics Boucing Ball Model:
In this project I had to develop a model that would accurately depict the motion of a ball that would bounce off the ground with air resistance. The only real challenge in the code was implementing the bounce of the ball, which would only want to be calculated when the ball achieved a specific position. To do this I had to take into account the radius of the ball and its position above the ground relative to its radius.

# Tunneling Project
This is a folder containing all of the contents I created to model the physical phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. In this folder there is both a Julia notebook and a python notebook, both notebooks deliver the exact same results, this is just a demonstration of both languages solving the same problem. In the notebooks and PDF file in this folder are detailed derivations to the mathematical expressions used to carry out this type of simulation. You can also find GIFs of a couple of the scenarios modeled in the notebook. This is a project that involved solving ODES, numerically modeling the ODEs, probability, and data visualization.

# Dash Project

This is a folder containing a simple data visualization example using plotly's dash library. By running the python script and launching the local server in the browser, you can observe the CO2 emissions of every country in the world from 1990-2019. Sample images of the page can be found in this folder.
